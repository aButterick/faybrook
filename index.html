        <p class="quote">"The Airedale Terrier, the largest member of the terrier group, is known to admirers as the King of Terriers, but he could just as easily be recognized as the King of Hearts who received his crown for his size, broad versatility, intelligence, and unswerving loyalty. The Airedale Terrier was developed in his native England as a companion and hunter for the working class citizens of Yorkshire. Today the breed is loved around the world for it prowess in the military, police forces, the Red Cross, the duck blind, and other venues, including the family home."</p></div>

        <p>You may find that there are many humans who think we are strong willed and stubborn, but that's just our intelligence and playfulness coming through... we are extremely capable and do love to please you, but if you are too boring and/or don't take the lead, well then, we will!</p></div>
